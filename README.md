# Basic_Gui_Tutorials_Python
- This guide has been created by Hamza Slaoui Habib.
- This is a beginners guide
- You are free to use this guide as a basic to learn or complement your knowledge for creating a GUI in Python (using Tkinter).
- This guide is assuming that you have some basics in python as well as in GUI.
- The basics needed for GUI is mainly knowing what is a Label, a Button, Frame, Window... etc. how to implement them is shown in the different codes.
- Some of the guides are complementary to each other. Which means, for example, if you reach the tutorial about files or checkboxes, you will see buttons and labels already implemented. Hence, if you are looking for something specific, please bear in mind this. You might need to have a quick look in the previous guides.
- Most,if not all the functions in these guides are basic and simplified. Since it is aim at beginners, especially in GUI, all the functions are not optimized for the best use of memory and space but mainly to show the roops to create and implement a GUI in python.
- This tutorial has been created after following the course offered by freecodechamp.org
- This guide has been created following my personal learning journey. I have been creating GUIs in a different language (Java fyi) but most of the guides I found where long and repetitive in terms of the knowledge I already have about GUI while i needed only the pure syntax in order to adapt to a different language. Hence, you too can use this guide to adapt yourself in terms of syntax and pure coding language for python. Hopefully by covering the basics for the syntax, you will be able to quickly transpose and adapt the knowledge you developped in another language here in python.
